                <p>Nissan is one of the most famous Japanese domestic-market automakers. It produces a number of models that are designed for the Japanese domestic market, including the Nissan Micra, Altima and Sunny.</p>

                <p>Nissan is based in Japan and many of its models are designed solely for the Japanese market. However, the company also has a strong presence in other global markets, including North America and Europe.</p>

                    <p>As a result, not all Nissan cars are Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) models. Whether or not a particular Nissan model is JDM will ultimately depend where it was originally sold.</p>

                <p class="text-center">In 2007, Nissan discontinued the Skyline name from its newest sports car, and the GT-R became a model in its own right.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">The GT-R was a bold move, but it ended up paying off. Not only is the GT-R widely considered one of the best Japanese sports cars ever built, but it also helped boost Nissan's popularity in Japan.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Powered by a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, the GT-R is an absolute monster on both the track and the street. Its latest model can reach 0-60 mph in under 3 seconds and top speeds of around 200 mph.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The GT-R offers a combination of superb performance and comfortable luxury, making it one of the most capable sports cars on the market.</p>
