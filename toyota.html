The subtle body sculpting and use of Ridox front fenders and BMW Lime Rock grey paint on this demo A80 owned by Naohiro Yahagi preceded an even more aggressive-looking package from Varis—the Supreme Wide Body kit—that really pushes out the fenders, but we're partial to Naohiro's narrow body project.</p>

                <p class="text-center">This car was a top-ten contender on multiple top tens throughout its lifespan. It was well-known in the motorsports community as the "King of Rallying" during its reign in competition, winning first place in several events from 1983 to 1986.</p>
