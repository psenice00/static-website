        <h1 id="main-heading">Some curiosities and funfacts about JDM</h1>

        <p class="sup-header">Japan is the 2nd biggest car-manufacturing country in the world</p>
        <p class="main-content">As of 2020, the Japanese car market manufactured 8.33 million units of cars and held the second spot on the passenger car production ranking list, although China dominated on the first place with 21.39 million units of cars, surpassing Japan by almost 3 times. Japan is undoubtedly a car-manufacturing superpower.</p>
        
        <p class="sup-header">Not all Japanese cars are JDM cars</p>
        <p class="main-content">JDM cars are sold only on Japanese soil, and foreigners can only come pick one up after a certain amount of time. Japanese car companies on the other hand have their branches in many countries, and the two sides of the market sell different types of cars depending on the general public preferences. Even the 2021 Honda Odyssey has 2 variations that do not resemble each other one bit. One looks cooler but the other has more room to spare.</p>
        
        <p class="sup-header">Drifting</p>
        <p class="main-content">If you’ve seen enough of Hollywood’s booming movies industry, then you might have heard of the Fast and Furious series. One film in particular features JDM cars in action. You’re right, it is Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift. The stunts in the movies aren’t far-fetched at all from real life. Enthusiasts flock to the stores for this specific reason. Everyone can become a petrolhead, but not everyone can pull it off the way Han (the main character) did in his movie. One thing is for sure, these cars do possess such an innate ability. You don’t have to take my word for it, make the purchase and see for yourself. <img src="/assets/images/tokyo_drift.webp" alt="screenshot from holywood movie - Fast and Furious: Tokyo drift"></p>
        
        <p class="sup-header">The limit on horsepower in Japan</p>
        <p class="main-content">The Japanese Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (JAMA) devised a limit on the maximum speed of all the future JDM cars, the same goes for all Japanese-built vehicles. Top speed markings are now restricted to 180 km/h (equivalent to 111.8 mph) on the speedometer, while also introducing a speed gauging device with the same limit so you better refrain from making any reckless stunts if you’re planning to live in Japan.</p>
        <p class="sup-header">JDM supercars</p>
        <p class="main-content">A super car is a really fast car that comes stock an example of a supercar is a lamborghini bugatti or hennessy venom some JDM
            supercars are Toyota FT1 and the Acura 2016 NSX the NSX cost is starting at $150,000 and the FT1 hasn't come out with a price yet
            but people are saying that it will be around the $100,000 price range.</p>
